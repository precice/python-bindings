        want to use your own solver for data mapping. As opposed to the usual preCICE mapping, only a
        single mesh (from the other participant) is now involved in this situation since an 'own'
        mesh defined by the participant itself is not required any more. In order to re-partition the
        received mesh, the participant needs to define the mesh region it wants read data from and
        write data to. The mesh region is specified through an axis-aligned bounding box given by the
        lower and upper [min and max] bounding-box limits in each space dimension [x, y, z]. This function is still
        experimental

        Parameters
        ----------
        mesh_name : str
            Name of the mesh you want to access through the bounding box
        bounding_box : array_like
            Axis aligned bounding box. Example for 3D the format: [x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max]

        Notes
        -----
        Defining a bounding box for serial runs of the solver (not to be confused with serial coupling
        mode) is valid. However, a warning is raised in case vertices are filtered out completely
        on the receiving side, since the associated data values of the filtered vertices are filled
        with zero data.

        This function can only be called once per participant and rank and trying to call it more than
        once results in an error.

        If you combine the direct access with a mapping (say you want to read data from a defined
        mesh, as usual, but you want to directly access and write data on a received mesh without a
        mapping) you may not need this function at all since the region of interest is already defined
        through the defined mesh used for data reading. This is the case if you define any mapping
        involving the directly accessed mesh on the receiving participant. (In parallel, only the cases
        read-consistent and write-conservative are relevant, as usual).

        The safety factor scaling (see safety-factor in the configuration file) is not applied to the
        defined access region and a specified safety will be ignored in case there is no additional
        mapping involved. However, in case a mapping is in addition to the direct access involved, you
        will receive (and gain access to) vertices inside the defined access region plus vertices inside
        the safety factor region resulting from the mapping. The default value of the safety factor is
        0.5, i.e. the defined access region as computed through the involved provided mesh is by 50%
        enlarged.
