* Use github actions for CI. https://github.com/precice/python-bindings/pull/67, https://github.com/precice/python-bindings/pull/68
* Do major restructuring of codebase. https://github.com/precice/python-bindings/pull/71
* Support `__version__` and provide version via python-versioneer. https://github.com/precice/python-bindings/pull/70
