## Guide to release new version of python-bindings
The developer who is releasing a new version of the python-bindings is expected to follow this work flow:

The release of the `python-bindings` repository is made directly from a release branch called `python-bindings-v2.1.1.1`. This branch is mainly needed to help other developers with testing.

1. Create a branch called `python-bindings-v2.1.1.1` from the latest commit of the `develop` branch.

2. [Open a Pull Request `master` <-- `python-bindings-v2.1.1.1`](https://github.com/precice/python-bindings/compare/master...master) named after the version (i.e. `Release v2.1.1.1`) and briefly describe the new features of the release in the PR description.

3. Bump the version in the following places:

    * `CHANGELOG.md` on `python-bindings-v2.1.1.1`.
    * There is no need to bump the version anywhere else, since we use the [python-versioneer](https://github.com/python-versioneer/python-versioneer/) for maintaining the version everywhere else.

4. [Draft a New Release](https://github.com/precice/python-bindings/releases/new) in the `Releases` section of the repository page in a web browser. The release tag needs to be the exact version number (i.e.`v2.1.1.1` or `v2.1.1.1rc1`, compare to [existing tags](https://github.com/precice/python-bindings/tags)). Use `@target:master`. Release title is also the version number (i.e. `v2.1.1.1` or `v2.1.1.1rc1`, compare to [existing releases](https://github.com/precice/python-bindings/tags)). 

    * *Note:* We use the [python-versioneer](https://github.com/python-versioneer/python-versioneer/) for maintaining the version. Therefore the tag directly defines the version in all relevant places.
    * *Note:* If it is a pre-release then the option *This is a pre-release* needs to be selected at the bottom of the page. Use `@target:python-bindings-v2.1.1.1` for a pre-release, since we will never merge a pre-release into master.

    a) If a pre-release is made: Directly hit the "Publish release" button in your Release Draft. Now you can check the artifacts (e.g. release on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyprecice/#history)) of the release. *Note:* As soon as a new tag is created github actions will take care of deploying the new version on PyPI using [this workflow](https://github.com/precice/python-bindings/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Upload+Python+Package%22).

    b) If this is a "real" release: As soon as one approving review is made, merge the release PR (from `python-bindings-v2.1.1.1`) into `master`.

6. Merge `master` into `develop` for synchronization of `develop`.

7. If everything is in order up to this point then the new version can be released by hitting the "Publish release" button in your Release Draft. This will create the corresponding tag and trigger (publishing the release to PyPI)[https://github.com/precice/python-bindings/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Upload+Python+Package%22].

8. Update Spack package (refer to `python-bindings/spack/README.md`).
